# ML: Unsupervised Learning (Module #10 of FinTech Bootcamp)

In this challenge, I used unsupervised learning algorithms (KMeans, PCA) to create clusters of cryptocurrency tokens based on past performance. I used the elbow method to find the optimal level for 'k', and optimized clusters with Principal Component Analysis.

## Technologies

[scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) - For machine learning algorithms.

`from sklearn.cluster import KMeans`

`from sklearn.decomposition import PCA`

`from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler`

[pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/) - For data structuring and analysis.

[hvplot](https://hvplot.holoviz.org) - For interactive visualizations

## Lessons Learned

1- Applied the K-means algorithm to identify the groups of a specified dataset.

2- Applied data preprocessing approaches often used along with the K-means algorithm.

3- Enhanced the machine learning algorithms by applying the principal component analysis.
